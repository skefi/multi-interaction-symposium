<p><strong>We need to talk about the topology of interaction
networks</strong></p>
<p>Author: <span style="color: DarkCyan;"> Marco A. R. Mello </span>
(University of São Paulo, Brazil)</p>
<p>By investigating two classical dilemmas about interactions between
organisms of different species, we arrived at an integrative solution,
which we presented as a new cognitive model. In this talk, I tell this
story and explain what we discovered together with our collaborators
along this journey. First, we will explore together what the two
dilemmas had in common. Second, we will see how this theoretical
connection could be better understood through a graphical model. Third,
we will find out how this graphical model was turned into an algorithmic
model able to predict the four most common network topologies observed
in nature. Finally, although our cognitive model was originally designed
for antagonisms in monolayer networks, after a series of empirical tests
and logical deductions it proved to apply also for mutualisms and
multilayer networks. Now we are working to develop our model into a new
syntactic theory. What consequences do our findings have for basic and
applied Ecology?</p>

<p><strong>How do non-trophic interactions shape ecological
stability?</strong></p>

<p>In the context of global change, understanding ecosystem stability is
a subject of great importance for biodiversity preservation. However,
ecological stability can be measured using various metrics. This
multiplicity of metrics raises the question of their interdependence,
i.e. whether they are correlated with each other or not. Previous
studies addressed this point by investigating the behavior of stability
metrics in trophic networks. However, in nature, species are well-known
to interact in various ways other than feeding (e.g. facilitation,
competition). Recent studies have shown that incorporating the diversity
of interaction types in classical ecological models could resolve
discrepancies between experiments and theory and drastically affect
species diversity and overall biomass. However, these previous studies
have mainly focused on investigating species coexistence, and, so far,
very little work has been done on dynamical response to perturbations.
The question of how the diversity of interactions affects the stability
of ecological communities remains largely open. Here, we investigate how
integrating four non-feeding interactions affects the stability of
trophic communities using more than 20 different stability metrics.
Specifically, we ask: how does the incorporation of non-trophic
interactions in a trophic network affect stability metrics individually?
Do the correlations between the stability metrics change with the
incorporation of non-trophic interactions, and if yes, how? We found
that these additional interactions affect the different stability
metrics as well as their interdependence compared to an ecological
community in which only feeding interactions are taken into account. Our
results highlight the importance of incorporating the diversity of
interactions into ecological theory to improve our fundamental
understanding of the stability of ecological systems.</p>

<p><strong>Mutualism increases diversity, stability, and function of
multiplex networks that integrate pollinators into food
webs</strong></p>

<p>Ecosystems are composed of complex networks of many species
interacting in many ways. While ecologists have long studied food webs
of feeding interactions, recent studies increasingly focus on
mutualistic networks including plants that exchange food for
reproductive services provided by animals such as pollinators. Here, I
synthesize both types of consumer-resource interactions to study the
effects of mutualism on ecosystems at the species, guild, and
whole-community levels. I find that consumer-resource mechanisms
underlying plant-pollinator mutualisms can increase persistence,
productivity, abundance, and temporal stability of both mutualists and
non-mutualists in food webs. These effects strongly increase with floral
reward productivity and are qualitatively robust to variations in the
prevalence of mutualism and pollinators feeding upon resources in
addition to rewards. This work advances the ability of network theory to
synthesize different types of interactions using common ecological
mechanisms and illustrates how mutualism can enrich the diversity,
stability, and function of complex ecosystems. I end with a discussion
of how this theory can provide general insights for terrestrial
ecosystems.</p>

<p><strong>Exploring the multiplex metanetwork of North American bird
interactions</strong></p>
<p>Authors: <span style="color: DarkCyan;"> Vincent Miele </span> (CNRS,
France), Stephane Dray (CNRS, France), Marc Ohlman (Grenoble University,
France), Phoebe Zarnetske (Michigan State University, USA)</p>
<p>Given the recent evidence that birds are declining in populations and
shifting their ranges in response to climate change, it is now
interesting to understand how much avian interaction networks are
similarly changing (or not) over space and time. Here we apply network
modeling of avian biodiversity and avian biotic interactions through
space and time (1997-present), based on a compiled database of nearly
10,000 bird-bird interactions for more than 500 bird species across
North America, and the publicly available North American Breeding Bird
Survey and eBird occurrence data. We will present the first multiplex
metanetwork of bird interactions, including trophic and non-trophic
interactions (e.g., negative -,- or -,0; positive +,+ or +,0; and
predator-prey -,+), collected throughout the USA. We will then
investigate the structure of this metanetwork using network science
analysis and finally connect these network patterns with bird
observations at different scales.</p>

<p><strong>Invasive species modulate the structure and stability of a
multilayer mutualistic network</strong></p>
<p>Author: <span style="color: DarkCyan;"> Agustin Vitali </span>
(Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel)</p>
<p>Species interactions are the backbone of the structure and dynamics
of communities. The extensive research into the link between structure
and stability has been primarily theoretical and focused on monotrophic
networks. Therefore, how the disruption of multitrophic interactions
alters communities’ response to perturbations in nature remains an open
question. Here, we explored how non-native ungulates affect
pollination-seed dispersal multilayer networks in Patagonia, Argentina.
Ungulates disrupt a hummingbird-mistletoe-marsupial keystone
interaction, which alters community composition. We calculated
interlayer connectivity, modularity, and species’ roles in connecting
modules for intact vs. invaded networks. To link structural changes to
stability, we quantified network tolerance to a single random species
removal (disturbance propagation) and sequential species removal
(robustness) using a stochastic coextinction model. Non-native ungulates
reduced the connectivity between pollination and seed dispersal and
produced fewer modules with a skewed size distribution. Moreover,
species shifted their structural role, primarily from connectors to
peripherals, thereby fragmenting the network by reducing the “bridges’’
among modules. These structural changes altered the dynamics of
cascading effects in the community, increasing disturbance propagation
and reducing network robustness. Our results highlight the importance of
understanding the mechanisms that alter the structure and subsequent
stability of multitrophic communities in nature.</p>

<p><strong>Connecting ecological networks across dimensions: new
insights and new struggles</strong></p>
<p>Author: <span style="color: DarkCyan;">Sérgio Timóteo</span>
(University of Coimbra, Portugal)</p>
<p>The use of network approaches to the study of biotic interactions has
seen a noticeable increase since its introduction into the field of
ecology by mid-1980s. It helped us to understand structure and
functioning of whole communities, their ability to withstand or predict
responses to disturbances, and even evolutionary insights. However,
networks were often looked at as separate entities. Recently, multilayer
networks have been adopted as a way to bridge this gap, allowing the
connect and incorporate dependencies across time, space or distinct
types of interactions. This new approach to ecological networks brings
however new challenges. How do we connect these different layers? What
should we measure and how much? How do we standardize interactions
within and between layers? I will present different approaches to
distinct systems, to show how ecological multilayer networks provided us
with a different understanding about community functioning and species
roles. On the other hand, I will reflect on some of the struggles found
in carrying out those same studies.</p>

<p><strong>Limits to sustainable scale: multilayer social-ecological
network structure constrains cooperative management of common-pool
resources</strong></p>
<p>Authors: Isaak Mengesha (University of Amsterdam, NL), Tuan M. Pham
(University of Copenhagen, Denmark), <span style="color: DarkCyan;">
Andrew K. Ringsmuth </span> (University of Graz, Austria; Complexity
Science Hub Vienna, Austria)</p>
<p>Sustainable management of common-pool resources (CPR) in the absence
of centralised government through, for example, informal institutions,
has been seen in both field work [1] and controlled experiments with
games [2]. However, this work has focused on small-scale systems and the
extent to which the derived principles of social- ecological resilience
might also apply at larger scales is not fully understood [3]. Here we
study the scaling of CPR management dynamics in a stylized multilayer
social-ecological network model. We adapt a prior evolutionary
game-theoretic model in which a social network of resource harvesters
adaptively choose between a selfish harvesting strategy and a socially
optimal strategy, the latter being a social norm enforced by
peer-to-peer sanctioning [4,5]. We extend this by adding empirically
informed network structure to the resource, creating a multilayer
social-ecological network model with multiscale dynamics. We formulate a
coarse-graining analysis to study how large-scale dynamics emerge from
interconnected local patches. Results show that resource management by
peer-to-peer sanctioning is limited by network topology: at large
scales, norm defectors can cluster to escape sanctioning and overharvest
with impunity. This provides the first formal demonstration of scaling
limits to peer-to-peer CPR management. We discuss implications for
real-world sustainable governance.</p>
